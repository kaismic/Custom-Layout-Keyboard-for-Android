# Custom Layout Keyboard for Android

This app is made for personal usage but anyone can modify and use the app if they want.

I built this app because there were no good android keyboards which allowed me to use a custom key layout of my own.

Layout is based on Colemak layout but slightly modified.

Created Based on Microsoft SwiftKey.

Implements most of the basic functionality of Microsoft SwiftKey such as swipe on spacebar to change language, swipe on the letters to delete by word and long press to input subtexts.

To change the key layouts change the values of the key list of the kotlin files under the 'layout' folder or MainActivity.kt.
