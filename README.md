Anyone can modify and use this app for personal use.

No commercial use.

I built this app because there were no good android keyboards which allowed me to use a custom key layout of my own.

Layout is based on the Colemak layout but slightly different.

Created based on Microsoft SwiftKey.

Implements most of the basic functionality of Microsoft SwiftKey such as swipe on spacebar to change language, swipe on the letters to delete by word and long click to input subtexts.

To change the key layout, change the strings of the "row1/2/3Letters" in the kotlin files "EnglishLayout.kt" or "KoreanLayout.kt" in "app/src/main/java/com/soobakjonmat/customlayoutkeyboard/layout" folder or "subTextRow1/2/3Letters" MainActivity.kt to change subtext layouts.

Current Supported Languages:
- English
- Korean

Tested Devices:
